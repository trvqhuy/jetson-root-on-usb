# üîå Jetson Root on USB

> Move your Jetson Nano‚Äôs root filesystem to a USB drive ‚Äî boost performance, reduce SD card wear, and simplify development.

This project provides a safe, interactive script to install the root filesystem of a Jetson Nano (4GB or 2GB) onto a USB flash drive or SSD, and configure it to boot from that drive using `PARTUUID` for stability. Inspired by [JetsonHacksNano/rootOnUSB](https://github.com/JetsonHacksNano/rootOnUSB), this version modernizes and simplifies the process.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ **Interactive device selection** (`lsblk` prompt)
- ‚úÖ **Automated partitioning, formatting, and setup**
- ‚úÖ **Root filesystem copy with `rsync`**
- ‚úÖ **Robust PARTUUID-based boot config**
- ‚úÖ **Automatically builds initramfs for USB support**
- ‚úÖ **Safe ‚Äî backs up boot config**

## üß∞ Requirements

- NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB or 2GB)
- JetPack 4.5+ (Ubuntu-based)
- A working microSD card with Jetson OS
- USB 3.0 flash drive or SSD (16GB+ recommended)
- Internet access (for initramfs on first run)

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/jetson-root-on-usb.git
cd jetson-root-on-usb
```

### 2. Run the Script

```bash
chmod +x jetson-usb-boot-installer.sh
sudo ./jetson-usb-boot-installer.sh
```

The script will:

- Display available block devices (e.g., `sda`)
- Prompt you to confirm formatting the selected USB device
- Format the USB drive with GPT + EXT4
- Mount the USB and copy the entire root filesystem
- Update `/boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf` to point to the USB `PARTUUID`
- Generate and add an `initrd` entry (initramfs)

## üîÑ Reverting Back to SD Card Boot

If you ever want to boot back from the microSD card:

```bash
sudo cp /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf.backup /boot/extlinux/extlinux.conf
sudo reboot
```

---

## ‚úÖ Tested On

- Jetson Nano 4GB B01 ‚Äì JetPack 4.6.1
- Jetson Nano 2GB ‚Äì JetPack 4.6.1

Note: USB-only boot (without SD card) may require bootloader changes depending on board revision. Keeping the SD card inserted during boot usually ensures compatibility.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- This script **erases all contents** of the selected USB device.
- Do **not** run this on `/dev/mmcblk0` (your SD card) or your system disk.
- Make backups before starting.
